# CrossWordle
A Crossword adaption of the popular word guessing game Wordle

Crosswordle aims to generate a blank crossword, but instead of giving the player clues for each word, each horizontal or verticle word
can be clicked on to enter a game of Wordle. As the Wordle game progresses, the crossword will be updated with each correctly guessed letter.

Currently the game is a working clone of Wordle -- please feel free to clone the project and run in Godot.

The crossword aspect of the game is a current WIP.

The project is written in GDScript using Godot, and includes a Python script to organise a large text file of words into JSON files to be read 
by the game (see Tools folder)
